## `About`
A small beer application where you can read description about different beers from __Brewdog__ brewery and can sort them by ABV (alcohol by volume).

## `Technology`
- ```fetch``` (to fetch the API)
- ```for``` -loops
- ```eventListeners```

## `About the API` :beer:
I've used the [Punk API](https://punkapi.com) which holds the whole Brewdog beer catalogue.
